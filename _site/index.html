						<div class="inner">
							<header class="major">
								<h2>Interests</h2>
								<p>When I'm not hunting Higgs pairs, I entertain myself by participating in outreach events <br />and educating myself and others on topics in science, statistics and technology.</p>
							</header>
							<ul class="features">
								<li class="icon fa-bank">
									<h3>Social Dynamics</h3>
									<p>I participate as a <a href="http://www.uslua.org/">US LUA</a> delegate in the annual meeting with Congress in Washington, DC, to advocate for funding for high energy physics and present reports on recent achievements and discoveries.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-terminal">
									<h3>Programming</h3>
									<p>Datasauri is a group of young physicists, data scientists and software developers that came together during the 2015 THE Port Hackathon at CERN and Campus Biotech with the intent of solving the problem of organization of humanitarian data.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-wifi">
									<h3>Internet Of Things (IoT)</h3>
									<p>I participated in the world largest educational hackathon in San Mateo, CA. My team developed an app that uses the MyScript API as a basis for handwritten mathematical formula recognition from photos using your portable device.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-superscript">
									<h3>Mathematics</h3>
									<p>TEDxCERN is one of the many exciting events organized at CERN every year. As an assistant stage manager, I helped the organizers during the event, got the chance to interact with absolutely inspiring speakers in the backstage, and assisted them during rehersals.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-pencil">
									<h3>Art</h3>
									<p>As an official CERN guide, I lead tours of tourists and students who visit the laboratory. I conduct visits in English and Italian. My goal is to leave visitors with a better understanding of the importance of fundamental research, and curiousity towards High Energy Physics.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-home">
									<h3>Interior Decoration</h3>
									<p>A scientifically educated public is an empowered and responsible public. During the Nuit des Chercheurs, CERN volunteers set up a day of events in a large mall with the objective of making physics more accessible and fun for shoppers and passersby.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-forumbee">
									<h3>Bees</h3>
									<p>S'Cool lab gives me the opportunity to pursue my passion for innovative science education during my residency at CERN. Tutors such as myself welcome middle and high school students, as well as groups of teachers, and lead lab sections in which attendees will perform experiments with cloud chambers, X-rays and electron tubes.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-plane">
									<h3>Food and Travelling</h3>
									<p>My next goal is to start creating virtual realities for educational and commercial purposes, to enhance classroom experience and give people access to environments and equipments they wouldn't normally be able to benefit from. I also collaborated on a VR short movie about the painful experience of OCD in simple daily tasks.</p>
								</li>
								<li class="icon fa-graduation-cap">
									<h3>Teaching</h3>
									<p>MOOCs are an innovative way of making higher education available to millions of people around the world. While I personally use platforms like <a href="https://www.coursera.org/">Coursera</a> and <a href="https://www.udacity.com/">Udacity</a> to continue learning, I also plan to try to design my own MOOC in the future.</p>
								<li class="icon fa-book">
									<h3>Reading</h3>
									<p>My next goal is to start creating virtual realities for educational and commercial purposes, to enhance classroom experience and give people access to environments and equipments they wouldn't normally be able to benefit from. I also collaborated on a VR short movie about the painful experience of OCD in simple daily tasks.</p>
